## Why

I decided to make a tribute page for Steve Jobs as I always been inspired how he shaped our modern society by Introducing revolutionary products. In 2012 I read the Steve Jobs book by Walter Isaacson, which helped me to make a critical decision during my accademic career.When I do use an Apple product, I feel like I personally know Steve, the art and semplicity embedded in products such as iPhone , iPad and Macbook give the product its uniqueness.

## Outcomes

This was my first ever Tribute page. The purpose of this challenge was to grasp knowledge of new programming languages such as CSS and HTML to design a user friendly tribute page and prepare me for the @SchoolOfCode Bootcamp. Prior the tribute page, I watched some youtube videos, read documentation and taken a short course about the UX/UI fundamentals.


## Technologies

- CSS ( CSS to styles some of the element to make the website more attractive)
- HTML ( HTML  will be used to give a scheletron of the website)
